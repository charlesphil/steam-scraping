# Steam Scraping
***
This is a beginner project using the `lxml` and `requests` libraries to grab the titles, prices, tags, and platforms for
each "Popular New Releases" game on the [Steam storefront](https://store.steampowered.com/explore/new/).

Project idea originally from Chapter 2 of Yasoob Khalid's 
[Practical Python Projects](https://practicalpython.yasoob.me/chapter2.html).
Future projects will build off of this one to build a web-based API using Flask.
